Hello I am trying this for the first time.


Let's see how it works

Liam and Josh are lost in the woods. Where is everybody?

Someone tell James to go get Alice from the hospital.
John's number is 9988776655 call him on monday and tell him his sister had a baby girl Emma.
Emma is 2 pounds healthy baby. 

Hey Alice i heard! Is Emma crying? She must be keeping you busy all day. I promise once i get free
i'll come to see her. Love John.
